    This is a demo of the node-qvx (https://github.com/kmpm/node-qvx) library that uses information from 
    SCB / Statistics Sweden (http://www.scb.se/api/) and turns them into information usable by 
    products from http://qlik.com like QlikView and Qlik Sense Desktop.
    
    There are some transformations done to fit the flat table layout that qvx data can represent
    
    More documentation will be provided but for now you can just fetch data from...
    * https://qvx-demo.herokuapp.com/population/meta/variables
    
    ...and add these as web files in your qlik load script.
